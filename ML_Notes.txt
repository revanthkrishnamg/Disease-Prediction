K-Fold Cross-Validation: 
K-Fold cross-validation is one of the cross-validation techniques in which the whole dataset is split into k number of subsets, also known as folds, then training of the model is performed on the k-1 subsets and the remaining one subset is used to evaluate the model performance.

Support Vector Classifier: 
Support Vector Classifier is a discriminative classifier i.e. when given a labeled training data, the algorithm tries to find an optimal hyperplane that accurately separates the samples into different categories in hyperspace.

Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier: 
It is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that internally uses Bayes Theorem to classify the data points.

Random Forest Classifier: 
Random Forest is an ensemble learning-based supervised machine learning classification algorithm that internally uses multiple decision trees to make the classification. In a random forest classifier, all the internal decision trees are weak learners, and the outputs of these weak decision trees are combined i.e. mode of all the predictions is as the final prediction.
